**Lorem-Ipsumlike**  
A Rust project for generating and detecting Lorem Ipsum–like text using statistical methods.

This repository contains a simple, yet effective, implementation of a Lorem Ipsum text generator built with a Markov chain model and a heuristic detector that leverages a statistical spell-checking algorithm inspired by Peter Norvig's work. The project is designed to generate pseudo-Lorem Ipsum content based on a seed text and to analyze arbitrary text to determine whether it resembles Lorem Ipsum. It also supports features for partial matching, enabling identification of correct words embedded within "ipsum" text.

This project aims to provide a lightweight and easily extendable tool for experimenting with text generation and detection techniques in Rust. Whether you're looking to generate filler text or filter out non-standard content, **Lorem-Ipsumlike** offers a modular, idiomatic Rust implementation that can be integrated into larger projects or used as a standalone utility.

Features:

-   **Text Generation**: Generate Lorem Ipsum–like text using a simple Markov chain model.
    
-   **Text Detection**: Analyze text to detect if it is Lorem Ipsum–like, including partial word matching.
    
-   **Extensible Design**: Built with modular, idiomatic Rust to support future enhancements.
